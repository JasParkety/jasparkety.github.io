# From Athens to Vienna: Costas Joins the QiTASC Development Team <a name="intro"></a>

Moving to Vienna was a mutual decision for Costas and his wife Doksa who were thinking about the next step in their professional and private lives. Originally from Athens, Greece, they moved to Vienna in the summer of 2016 when Costas joined the QiTASC Development team and Doksa joined the test team soon thereafter.

We spoke to Costas about his experiences as a member of the QiTASC development team, the skills he's developed during his time here, and the projects he has most enjoyed working on.

## Why QiTASC? <a name="why"></a>
It was important for Costas and Doksa to find jobs that matched their skills and experience, each coming from an electronics and computer engineering background -- both academically and professionally. QiTASC's job opening, which was addressed towards English-speaking IT experts, first caught their attention because of its creative and unconventional design.

Costas described his Skype interview with QiTASC CEO Michael Zehender as being less like a rigid formality and more like an interesting conversation about programming problems with a long-time colleague. This gave him some insight into the professional but relaxed atmosphere at QiTASC. However, not speaking German before coming to Austria was an obvious barrier for the couple. As they planned their move, Costas and Doksa took German lessons in Greece to help prepare for their relocation to Vienna.


## Daily Life at QiTASC <a name="daily"></a>
Every morning at QiTASC, the development room gradually fills up with employees who start the day according to their personal schedules. From about 8am until 9am, developers can be found at their desks planning their day and finishing tasks from day before. Others spend the time catching up with each other over coffee about projects and issues. At 9am, when all the developers have arrived, a **daily stand-up** meeting is held to discuss ongoing work, challenges and new projects. In Costas' case, once the development team is synchronized for the day, he can organize his working time according to his current tasks and priorities.


## Skills Development <a name="skills"></a>
Costas describes how when he first joined the company as a mature junior developer, the QiTASC team immediately welcomed him and helped him integrate into his new role quickly and efficiently. Although Costas was hired as a developer, his first assignment at QiTASC was assisting with a testing project by undertaking the role of a test engineer. Gaining a user's perspective of INTACT early helped Costas to gain a better understanding of the software that he would soon be developing.

After only a few months and with the guidance of senior developers, Costas was taking on increasingly demanding tasks and responsibilities towards the development of INTACT. This has allowed him to undertake complex tasks on his own and contribute to an ever-increasing product quality and features set. Some of the skills Costas has strengthened during his nearly two years at QiTASC include using streams to write more elegant and powerful code as well as using **mocking** to enhance his unit testing skills. The company's transition from Java to Kotlin also allowed him to familiarize himself with a new programming language and keep up to date with fresh and useful technologies.

## Collaborative Projects <a name="collaboration"></a>
Since joining QiTASC, Costas has contributed to many different aspects of the company's product portfolio, including INTACT's **compound steps**, the [Audio Plugin](http://www.qitasc.com/articles/20180326-AudioPlugin) and integrating features and capabilities for both mobile and VoiP phones. The structure of the INTACT product as well as the definition and scope of the tasks allow everybody to work independently. However, Costas explains that there have been many times where a more demanding and complex feature has required [multiple people to collaborate and cooperate](http://www.qitasc.com/articles/20180430-peopleOfQitasc#audio) to deliver it.

In recent months, Costas has been part of a greenfield project for the development of an upcoming QiTASC product, which is thrilled to be working on. He especially enjoys that this project requires him and the team to employ creative thinking and problem solving, which he states are aspects of development that software engineers cherish. Additionally, the company holds occasionally **Hack Days**, dedicated to either kickstart a new project or focus on improving specific areas. During these Hack Days, the development team is either working towards a common goal or is split into smaller groups, with each group working together to achieve an overall goal.


## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Costas says he could not be happier about the experience, knowledge and skills he has gained since joining QiTASC in 2016. Since moving to Vienna, he has become an indispensable part of the development team and has contributed his talents to many critical aspects of QiTASC's INTACT as well as a forthcoming product we will soon be announcing.
