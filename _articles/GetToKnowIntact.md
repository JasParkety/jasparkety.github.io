subtext: Depending on the behaviours you're testing and whether they represent ongoing activities or single points in time, you might use INTACT in many different ways. Here we cover eight of the most common automation use cases, including core network testing, Internet of Things and charging conformity.
text: We've listened to your feedback, so this year we're shifting our documentation focus away from our extensive manual and more towards learning and letting users get a head start on using INTACT's features. Starting with Apptest, we'll be publishing additional tutorials over the next several weeks. As part of creating useful, trouble-free material, members of our documentation team try the tutorials out themselves using the same hardware and software that a customer would. This helps us write tutorials from the end user's point of view and ensures that we don't leave any steps out.
