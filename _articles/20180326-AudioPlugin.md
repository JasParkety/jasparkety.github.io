# New Feature: The INTACT Audio Plugin  <a name="Introduction"></a>

The **INTACT Audio Plugin** fulfils three purposes:

* Making phone call recordings
* Monitoring a speech channel
* Detecting and comparing announcements (Audio Fingerprinting)

All of the steps and configurations described in this article are available in a dedicated **INTACT Manual** [Audio and Speech Channel Steps and Compound Steps](https://docs.qitasc.com/intactsteps/audiointro/).


Using the **INTACT Audio Plugin** requires the following setup:
* A Raspberry Pi for each phone that is used for audio recording.
* The Raspberry Pi running a service called `Audio Service`.
* Each Raspberry Pi is connected through a USB sound card to a given phone using a special audio cable.
* A phone's unique mapping to the Raspberry Pi configured via **INTACT** to link the phone's serial number to the Raspberry's IP address.

## The Big Picture <a name="big"></a>
Whenever a recording is required on a given phone, **INTACT** looks up the IP address of the Raspberry Pi that it is configured to. **INTACT** connects to the `Audio Service` on a configured URL to **start**, **stop**, and eventually **retrieve** the recording. The recording is a `*.wav` file that is attached to the test report.

The `Audio Service` is an HTTP (REST) service that is located on a Raspberry Pi. It permits:

* Starting a recording
* Stopping a recording
* Starting a playback of a recording
* Stopping a playback of a recording
* Retrieving a recording
* Resetting the `Audio Service`

## How to Create Recordings <a name="recordings"></a>

A **Recording Step** is written in a test case, which records audio from a device. The recording is attached to the test report as a single channel (mono), 8-bit unsigned `wav` file with 8 kHz sample rate. This is an uncompressed, low-quality audio format that is sufficient for speech channel recordings.


## Speech Channel Monitoring <a name="monitor"></a>
Speech channel monitoring involves two phones (let's call them `A` and `B`) that are under **INTACT's** control. Whenever a call is established between the phones, **INTACT's** Speech Channel Monitoring steps can be used to assess speech channel quality.

The speech channel consists of two independent directions: `A => B` and `B => A`. When a speech channel monitoring step is used, phone `A` plays a given reference audio file using the `Audio Service`. At the same time, phone `B` records the call established between the phones. In parallel, the speech channel's **reverse direction** is covered by playing the reference audio file on `B` and recording it on `A`. The recordings on `A` and `B` are attached to the test report.

After creating the recordings, they are analyzed to judge the speech channel's quality as described below.

### How Speech Channel Monitoring Works

The reference audio files are fixed audio files that are located on the Raspberry Pi's `Audio Service`. They consists of beeps with a duration of **300ms** and a frequency of **800Hz** and **1100Hz**: One phone will play the 800Hz file and the other phone will play the 1100Hz file. The pauses between the beeps last **300ms**. Monitoring a speech channel's quality in a given direction (e.g. `A => B` or `B => A`) consists of playing back the reference file on `A` and recording it on `B`. The recording and analysis for both `A => B` and `B => A` are done once and in parallel.

When the recording on `B` has finished, the recorder audio file is analyzed to detect the locations and durations of beeps and pauses.

The recording's analysis uses:

* **Total number of beeps**: If the total number of beeps does not meet or exceed the minimum threshold of expected beeps, the monitoring is considered failed.

* **Predominant frequency**: The recording's predominant frequency **must match** the beeps' nominal frequency (800 Hz or 1100Hz). If the call channel is broken, a white noise recording would fail the frequency check.

* **Pause position and duration**: If a pause is too long, one or more beeps are missing from the recording.


## Audio Fingerprinting <a name="fingerprint"></a>
**Audio Fingerprinting's** purpose is to match a given recording against a database of reference announcements.

A given audio recording is compared to a set of reference recordings by using the **INTACT** `Audio Matcher`. The `Audio Matcher` reads the audio recording and uses an algorithm to compute a collection of **Audio Fingerprints**. This collection of fingerprints is characteristic of the recording. The fingerprints of the recording to be assessed is then **compared to a collection of fingerprints** that is calculated from reference recordings. Every comparison yields a **similarity score** between `0` and `100`. A higher number indicates a stronger similarity to the reference recording.

**Hint:** Audio fingerprints can be visualized as a cloud of points in a spectrogram. This point cloud is characteristic of the audio signal.

### Using the Audio Fingerprinting

**Audio Fingerprinting Stepdefs** are used to match reference files against recordings. The **INTACT log** then shows the scores for matching the given recording with the reference database.

**INTACT** matches a recording against a set of recordings announcements by:

* Calculating the recording's fingerprints.
* Comparing the recording's fingerprints with all reference announcements' fingerprints. Every comparison yields a similarity score.
* The best match is the match with the highest number of equal fingerprints.

When **INTACT** starts, all the `*.wav` files in the `referenceDirectory` are fingerprinted to build up a reference database. This is done for each profile and the reference database file name contains the profile identifier. **INTACT** detects changes in the reference `*.wav` files such that those changes are properly propagated to the reference database without re-indexing all the files.

If, for the best match, the number of equal fingerprints is below a configured **minimum confidence level**, the match is considered to be **failed**. The integer number of equal fingerprints is then converted to a percentage based on the total number of the recording's fingerprints. If this percentage is **lower than the minimum score** as given by the step, the match is a **low-quality match**.

The the match is only considered good if the similarity percentage is above the limit set by the stepdef

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The INTACT **Audio Plugin** expands the scope of testing by adding **speech channel monitoring** and the **Audio Fingerprinting** to its suite of features. The setup involves minimal hardware: A phone only needs a Raspberry Pi connected through a USB sound card to use these features. Both speech channel monitoring and Audio Fingerprinting provide **scores** to help determine if the **audio quality or content** matches your test's requirements.

If you would like to create test cases using the Audio Plugin, the INTACT Manual's [Audio and Speech Channel](https://docs.qitasc.com/intactsteps/audiointro/) chapter contains reference material about INTACT's built-in steps and and examples.
