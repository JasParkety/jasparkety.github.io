subtext: With the flick of a configuration switch, INTACT allows you to change between using virtual phones and real phones in your testing environment. This tutorial walks you through setting up a project and creating your own custom steps to automate virtual phones.
text: We've listened to your feedback, so this year we're shifting our documentation focus away from our extensive manual and more towards learning and letting users get a head start on using INTACT's features. Starting with Apptest, we'll be publishing additional tutorials over the next several weeks. As part of creating useful, trouble-free material, members of our documentation team try the tutorials out themselves using the same hardware and software that a customer would. This helps us write tutorials from the end user's point of view and ensures that we don't leave any steps out.
