subtext: In Austria, summer internships (Praktika) are a prerequisite for graduation from technical high schools (HTL). Therefore, every summer, QiTASC offers a couple of internship placements for high school students. This July, we welcomed 15-year-old Theo to our Vienna office. During his month-long internship, Theo had the opportunity to get familiar with INTACT and learn what it's like to work at a startup.

Following Theo's time at QiTASC, we asked him about his experience and for practical advice about doing an internship at a software startup. Here's what he had to say.

# Combining Academic Interests with Practical Experience <a name="interests"></a>
Theo told us that although he loves both English and computer science, he only learns about these subjects for a couple of hours per week at school. Upon starting his internship at QiTASC, Theo was surprised to learn that there were so many employees who were interested in the same topics as him. He described this as a "motivation boost" that will help him work towards a profession in computer science or software development. Theo had initially wanted to gain some coding skills like Java, but says he learned a lot more than he had hoped for. He found it interesting that INTACT has its own language, which he says is easy to learn and use.

# A Typical Day at QiTASC <a name="days"></a>
For most of his internship, Theo supported the test engineering team, where he got first-hand experience about using QiTASC's software. He also sat in with members of the development team to get insight into how they work on collaborative projects, and even attended an INTACT training session for new employees. Regardless of what task he was performing or what team he was assisting, Theo liked to start his workday with a cola and chatting with colleagues to catch up before getting to the "exciting" part of the day.

After finishing his cola, Theo would head to his workstation and could choose one of several tasks to work on. Theo's tasks included practising coding, following programming tutorials, or assisting the test team in developing and executing INTACT test cases. He said that although some tasks were difficult, the young and friendly team helped him develop his skills.

# Valuable Skills Gained <a name="skills"></a>
Theo says he always loved codes -- not just in games, but also trying things out, like figuring out how to change security settings. Theo shared with us how different QiTASC team members spent time showing him what different functions written in INTACT Studio did and what each function's component represented and was linked to. For him, gaining stronger code-reading/writing skills through collaborative learning sessions was very useful because it expanded his existing knowledge. This also made it easier for Theo to understand what the code meant as he was reading it, and helped him remember the code for future use. Theo says when he returns to school, he'll be able to apply all of the skills he learned at QiTASC in his computer science classes.

# Theo's Tips for Being a QiTASC Intern <a name="tips"></a>
Finally, we asked Theo to provide advice for other HTL students who might be interested in doing their summer internship at a software startup like QiTASC. He recommends that students who are comfortable using English, have some computer experience and are interested in coding join us for the summer. Theo says don't be shy: If you trust in yourself and your coworkers, you will learn a lot during your internship.

# Conclusion
In July, the Vienna QiTASC team welcomed our summer intern, Theo, to our office. To ensure he had a good learning outcome and a positive experience, Theo spent time with different departments before settling in to the test team for the majority of his internship. Theo had hoped to improve his technical skills -- especially coding -- and we're glad to have played a part in helping him do so. We look forward to seeing what Theo will do with his expanded skillset!
