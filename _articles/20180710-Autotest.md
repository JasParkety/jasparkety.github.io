# Managing Phones with the New INTACT INTACT Mobile App <a name="introduction"></a>

The new INTACT Mobile App is a rewrite of the existing Mobile App, using the latest Android APIs and library. It works by connecting to the INTACT Server and performing actions on the phone, such as making and receiving phone calls or SMSs, thereby allowing the INTACT Server to test a variety scenarios across many phones. In addition, a more robust networking layer has been added, thus the app and its communication should be more reliable in the future.

## New User Interface <a name="interface"></a>
The first thing that new users will notice is its new, cleaner appearance and multiple cards:

The app's improved UI now displays information about the phone, such as its serial number and IMEI. Previously, finding some of this information required a more complicated approach.


Additionally, the app shows when it is connected to INTACT, signal strength and even which *test case has acquired that phone*. The INTACT Mobile App supports Android version 6+ and takes full advantage of the new APIs that have been introduced in Android 8 (O) and 9 (P), which provide first-class support for operations such as programmatically making and ending calls.

## Better Device Management <a name="deviceManagement"></a>
In the previous INTACT Mobile App iteration, overriding an MSISDN could potentially cause SIM card issues. If SIM card was swapped, the MSISDN would have to be re-entered manually. Now when SIM cards are swapped, the override will be applied because of the new **Retain MSISDN** feature.

Users can also see what server they are connected to, or bot for those that are using QiTASC's TYCHE bot mode.

## Faster Speed and More Device Information <a name="speed"></a>
The UI isn't the only big change to the INTACT Mobile App: We've optimized phone-to-server communications for the new app, meaning phone acquisition and property retrieval are now almost instant -- phone properties are pushed to INTACT Server in real time. The phone properties in the example below contain the same information that users can also find at `localhost:8080/phones`.

This increased speed should also provide more reliable networking that significantly speeds up tests. In the past, when the INTACT Mobile App accessed phone properties, the Remote Phone Service would would retrieve properties for ALL phones (e.g. 32 phones) *and* return all of them. Now property retrieval will be instant regardless of the number of phones. This means phones are acquired faster and properties are easier to access.

During internal testing, we found an aggregate of several hours in reduced test-running time per week. Over time, these small changes make a huge difference to test projects!

## Experimental Release <a name="experimental"></a>
The new INTACT Mobile App is a new release and has been rewritten from the ground up. Although it has been tested using QiTASC's comprehensive internal acceptance test suite, some issues may remain for certain phone models or networks. This could result in non-backwards compatible issues. However, the development team is continuing to test internally and releasing the new INTACT Mobile App as an experimental release in order to get **early feedback from customers**.

## Making Life Easier for Testers <a name="simplicity"></a>

One of the biggest benefits of the INTACT Mobile App is that it provides valuable reference material to test engineers in a single place. Testers can see who is using the phone, or if it is connected and they no longer need to navigate through the phone to finds IDs. In combination with our new Phone Plugin, which makes devices accessible through INTACT Studio, users not longer need to get up from their desk or contact someone at another location to check on a phone's status or characteristics.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The new INTACT Mobile App provides users with greater access to information about the devices they use with INTACT. By updating the UI to include multiple cards and an easy-to-navigate layout, finding phone properties and connection information is simpler and straightforward. Additionally, the internal workings of the INTACT Mobile App have significantly cut down the amount of time that it takes for it to communicate with the INTACT Server, meaning phones are acquired faster and properties are accessed nearly real-time. Finally, users no longer need to get up from their desks, ask a co-worker in a remote location, or press multiple keys to find information like who is using the phone and on what test case it is running.
