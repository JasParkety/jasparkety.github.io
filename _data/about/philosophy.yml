HighQuality:
  header: High Quality

      The quality of our test solutions is only as good as the quality of <div class="italicStyleYML">your</div> products when they reach the market.
      As businesses increasingly integrate automation into their product lifecycles, the importance of maintaining -- and improving -- quality has never been greater. <br> Choosing a new approach to testing is a decisive moment in a company's position in the market. With the right tools and processes, as well as the knowledge to make an informed decision, automated testing can create profound improvements in the quality of your products.
      <br>
      At QiTASC, we understand the significance of such an investment in quality assurance.
      <br>
      Our employees are also <b>intaQt</b> users, and use our products daily for internal testing purposes. This helps us constantly find ways to enhance our software, while identifying and correcting issues immediately.

      The QiTASC team strives to understand our customers' goals and have developed testing solutions that allow these goals to become a reality.
      By creating a holistic suite of test tools, QiTASC aims to provide an end-to-end approach to testing that encompasses every aspect of quality assurance -- from defining the test scope, to executing the tests and analysing the results.
      <br>
      Our software development is grounded in a deep understanding of the industries and use cases that our products. are tailored to. This allows us to construct a testing framework that can both focus on small, obscure and even unexpected problems that can occur. At the same time, we keep the big picture in mind by providing structured, comprehensive software that is able to "wrap around" entire projects.

Results:
  header: Immediate Results
  text: |
      Delivering, immediate results does not just imply speed
      <br>
      Results must be easy to understand and tailored to a test project's needs. Data generated in real-time by QiTASC's products are available in multiple formats, including summary reports, trace and protocol logs, XML files trace and more.
      Additionally, our reporting and defect management products are compatible with most test project management tools, continuous integration frameworks and issue tracking systems. To us, providing diverse forms of test output and flexible integration options means our customers can understand and use results in the most efficient, appropriate way possible.
      <br>
      Quality assurance is a time-sensitive business activity, but it does not need to be stressful.
      We understand that obtaining accurate, timely results is just as important as testing products and services themselves. By automating test creation, execution, analysis and even defect management, QiTASC provides customers with precise, detailed information from the moment a test starts running.

      Complex products require complex QA solutions, but that does not mean testing should be complicated
      <br>
      We consider customizeable testing tools to be just as important as their ease of use.
      At QiTASC, we are committed to empowering our customers so that they feel 100% confident in their products market-readiness after using our software.
      <br>
      Our software has been developed to provide users with a logical sense of how to structure their tests, how and what to configure, and how to interpret the results. Each product has been created with different user types in mind, including both technical experts with coding experience and those with no programming experience.
      This is especially beneficial for teams with skill variation, because it allows advanced users to focus on any abstract issues that arise, while beginners can feel comfortable using <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt</div>'s natural-sounding test language and start writing test cases right away.
