      Verify hundreds of parameters and metadata within seconds during a test or after data has been collected. With the click of a button, <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt Verification</div> checks device, subscriber and event details, internal infrastructure, legal requirements, financial characteristics or any other parameter that you wish to configure.
      <br>
      <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt Verification</div> may be executed online as part of a live test case or offline, for example if records are not collected until, for example, the following day.
      <br> <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt Verification</div> has been used checking large sets of records including:
  enumeration:
      - Phone and subscriber details, such as phone type, service provider, phone number and phone number format.
      - Call and event details, such as calling parties, lengths of time, passed/failed steps.
      - Internal infrastructure or network characteristics.
      - Legal requirements, such as those defined by telecommunications regulators.
      - Financial characteristics, including charges and tariffs.
      - Ensuring data from decentralized sources and different formats conforms to a common standard.

VerificationRules:
  header: Verification Rules
  text: |
      <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt Verification</div> automates the comparison of call detail records (CDRs) or event detail records (EDRs) and XML files against a configured set of Verification Rules.
      Rules define the type of check that INTACT Verification will perform against the selected records, as well as which properties to compare.
      Examples of Verification Rules include:
  enumeration:
      - Phone and subscriber details, such as phone type, service provider, phone number and phone number format.
      - Call and event details, such as calling parties, lengths of time, passed/failed steps.
      - Internal infrastructure or network characteristics.
      - Legal requirements, such as those defined by telecommunications regulators.
      - Financial characteristics, including charges and tariffs.
      - Ensuring data from decentralized sources and different formats conforms to a common standard.

VerificationSelectors:
  header: Verification Selectors
  text: <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt Verification</div> simplifies defining the criteria to be checked by using Selectors that tell <div class="boldStyleYML">intaQt</div> which records to check against Verification Rules and which to exclude. Because only certain records or Tickets should be chosen, Selectors are a critical part of eliminating unnecessary data from the Verification process, which helps to keep these tests running smoothly and quickly.

VerificationOnOff:
  header: Online and Offline Verification
  text: Online Verification refers test case executions that include Verification steps that are executed while the test case is in process. A Verification step collects CDRs/EDRs produced by the test case. Subsequently, a step runs Verification against the collected tickets. <br> Offline Verification involves Verification after a test case execution is no longer in process. For example, if CDRs/EDRs are generated once per day, as opposed to during the live test case, Online Verification may not be possible. While it is possible to set-up a project to use Online Verification in this case, the process is quite intricate and requires a lot of know-how. Therefore, we have implemented a Verification UI specifically for such offline use cases, which simplifies the Offline Verification process.
